# Real Time GPS Tracking
This application performs real-time tracking and sends it along with the engine RPM to a server for later viewing through an interface designed on a web page. The RPM are obtained through an OBD2 that connects through bluetooth with the cell phone which using libraries is able to obtain the rpm of the engine. 

Note: this application is also able to obtain and send the speed of the vehicle, however due to project requirements it will not be taken into account.
